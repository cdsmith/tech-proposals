# Community Grants

## Introduction

This proposal is for the Haskell Foundation to undertake a direct small grant
program, funded by individual donations to the foundation, to distribute funding
where it can make a difference to the Haskell community.  The aim is to make the
Haskell Foundation a more appealing target for individuals wishing to donate for
the good of the entire Haskell community.  This indefinite ongoing program would
accept submissions from the community on a rolling basis, and award up to $2000
grants to individuals as a stipend to support their work on the proposed
project.

The amount of money involved is small, so the primary risk of the proposal is
that funding decisions would generate discouragement or ill will from rejected
submissions.  The risk can be partially mitigated by the use of a random lottery
system to select winners after an initial selection of submissions that the
Foundation believes are worth accepting.

## Background

Numerous mechanisms currently exist for individuals to financially support parts
of the Haskell community, including projects that have individually set up
fundraising, individuals who have requested donations via Patreon, GitHub
sponsorships, etc., and purchase of services and subscriptions to content.  Each
of these choices supports a specific part of the Haskell community, and none of
them offer a default way to contribute to Haskell as a whole.

The Haskell Foundation now also accepts individual donations, and its
organizational mission is consistent with being precisely such an appealing
target for general-purpose donations to Haskell.  However, there is currently
not a clear picture for how funds make it from donations to the Haskell
Foundation to directly encouraging contributions to the Haskell community.  In
surveys of the community, individuals who have decided not to contribute to the
Haskell Foundation have given the reason that they don't see that their
contributions would support the Haskell open source community.

The HFTP process superficially appears to offer such a path.  However, there are
several barriers to its being used directly by individuals or small projects for
which funding could make a difference.  Note that "individuals and small
projects" describes a vast portion of crucial Haskell libraries and tools.

1. The HFTP process is not encouraging to individuals looking for small amounts
   of funding, and says things like "Typically, this includes many rounds of
   discussion with HF leaders, Haskell library maintainers, and the broader
   community, several iterations on the design of the proposal, and some effort
   at prototyping the proposed change."
2. The benefit of small grants can depend on life circumstances, such as one's
   need for child care, willingness to leave an employer, etc.  Individuals may
   prefer not to include this information in a document open for public comment.

Thus, the HFTP process isn't a great fit for direct requests from individuals or
small projects for financial support.  Furthermore, the HFTP process gives an
explicit example of a "Summer of Code" style program as within scope for an HFTP
proposal.  This is such a proposal.

## Motivation

As discussed above, the primary motivation for this proposal is to make the
Haskell Foundation an appealing target for individuals who wish to donate money
for the good of the entire Haskell community, without expressing any specific
opinion on where that money is best invested.  This requires a mechanism for
community decision-making about how to distribute donations among the many
worthy causes where they could do some good, beyond the day to day operations
of the foundation itself.

There are several secondary motivations, as well.

* We hope to increase open source contributions to Haskell by finding high
  efficiency investments where a small contribution can make a big difference
  because someone is in a place where they are blocked from contributing.  This
  doesn't necessarily have to be a top priority for the community.  If a small
  investment can help even a second-tier priority, it is still a good thing.
* We hope to build more community support and awareness of people contributing
  to Haskell.  Bringing the community together in support of a shared goal can
  clear the path of procedural obstacles.

## Goals

The goal of this proposal is to set up a small grant program administered by the
Haskell Foundation.

Submissions to the grant program should come from individuals who feel they
could perform additional work on projects of benefit to the Haskell community if
they had extra funding.  These individuals would write a short summary of their
intended work, answering the following questions:

* What are you intending to do, and how will it benefit the Haskell community?
* Why are you the right person to do this work?
* How much funding are you asking for, and how will it make your work possible?

As a condition of receiving a grant, individuals will agree to report back to
the Haskell community in detail within two months on the results of their
efforts, in the form of a blog post shared on discourse.haskell.org.
Individuals who do not follow through on this commitment are ineligible for
future grants.

Submissions will be evaluated by a Community Grant Committee, consisting of five
members chosen by the Haskell Foundation executive team.  An email list will be
set up, readable only by the executive team and Community Grant Committee, for
receiving and discussing submissions.  Once per month, the Haskell Foundation
executive team will a communicate to the committee how much funding is available
for grants, based on the program's budget, which is at the discretion of the
Foundation.

Community Grant Committee members will use approval voting to determine which
submissions to accept, using their informed judgement.  Committee members will
consider whether there is broad consensus that the result would be desirable,
how much impact the grant is likely to have on the probability for success, and
the overall impact if the project succeeds.  The committee will not accept a
proposal if its completion would be controversial in any way, and will instead
refer the submitter to the HFTP process to build consensus and resolve any
disagreement.  A submission is accepted if it receives majority support from
the committee.  When a submission is not accepted, the committee may choose, by
majority vote again, to provide feedback to the submitter on how their proposal
could be improved.  Otherwise, the results of the vote are not announced, to
avoid embarrassment or hard feelings.

A random lottery system will then be used to award grants to accepted proposals,
continuing until either the approved submissions are exhausted, or a submission
is drawn which cannot be funded with the remaining budget.  The committee will
then recommend to the executive team to award the grants selected in the
lottery.  The executive team will have final authority to award grants.

## People

- The Haskell Foundation executive team and board will determine how many
  projects are chosen by setting a budget as funds are available.
- There will be a Community Grant Committee of five people responsible for
  evaluating whether to accept each submission.  This will be chosen by the
  Haskell Foundation executive team.
- Proposals will be written and submitted by various members of the community
  who feel their contributions would benefit from funding.

## Resources

The project can consume whatever resources are allocated to it, at the
discretion of the Haskell Foundation board or executive team.

## Timeline

- Choosing a Community Grant Committee may require apprroximately a month.
- Once there is a Community Grant Committee, the first round of grants can occur
  as soon as the budget is available.  The committee will choose new grants
  monthly after that.

## Outcomes

* We expect an increase in individual donations to the Haskell Foundation.
* We expect an increase in project work by people receiving grants.
* We anticipate the possibility of some negative sentiment as some grants are
  not awarded.  We seek to minimize this by choosing winners in a random
  lottery, so that failure to receive an award isn't seen as rejection by the
  community.

## Risks

The main risk worth considering is that funding decisions will generate
resentment or discouragement.  To mitigate this, submissions that meet the
initial bar will be accepted in a lottery process, where the selection is at
random.  Projects not selected will be automatically pre-approved for the next
selection, if the author confirms that they are still interested in continuing.

A second risk is that Haskell Foundation funds are not spent on the best
projects.  We mitigate this risk by limiting the amount of the grants so that
the risk is lower.  Additionally, there's an initial assessment of all
submissions to ensure they meet a high bar where investment of Haskell
Foundation funds is likely to generate a good return.
